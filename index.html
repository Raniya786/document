            <h1 style="color: green;font-size: 200%;">Abstraction</h1>
            <p style="font-size:175% ;"> Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important feature of object oriented programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying only 
              essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world,
               hiding the background details or implementation. Consider a real life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the acce-
               lerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know about how on pressing accelerator the speed is 
               actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car.
                This is what abstraction is.Abstraction using Classes: We can implement Abstraction in C++ using classes. Class helps us to group data members and
                 member functions using available access specifiers. A Class can decide which data member will be visible to outside world and which is not.
               Abstraction in Header files: One more type of abstraction in C++ can be header files. For example, consider the pow() method present in math.h header
                file. Whenever we need to calculate power of a number, we simply call the function pow() present in the math.h header file and pass the numbers as 
                arguments without knowing the underlying algorithm according to which the function is actually calculating power of numbers.

             <h1 style="color: rgb(98, 6, 6);font-size: 200%;">Data Encapsulation</h1>
          <p style="font-size:175% ;">Data Encapsulation in C++
            Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data,
             and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of data 
             hiding.Data encapsulation is a mechanism of bundling the data, and the functions that use them and data abstraction is a mechanism of
              exposing only the interfaces and hiding the implementation details from the user.  C++ supports the properties of encapsulation and 
              data hiding through the creation of user-defined types, called classes. We already have studied that a class can contain private, 
              protected and public members. By default, all items defined in a class are private</p>
